You are given an array prices, where prices[i] denotes the price of a stock on the ith day. Find the maximun profit that you can make by buying a single stock and then selling it in the future. If it is not possible to make profit then return 0. Note: Consider 1-based indexing.

Examples:
Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5
Explaination: You can buy the stock on day 1 at price = 1 and sell it on day 5 at price = 6. Hence, the profit is 5 and that is the maximum that we can obtain from the given prices.

CODE:

class Solution 
{
    public int maximumProfit(int prices[])
    {
        int ans=0, minb=prices[0];
        for(int i=0; i<prices.length; i++)
        {
            minb=Math.min(minb, prices[i]);
            ans=Math.max(ans, prices[i]-minb);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
